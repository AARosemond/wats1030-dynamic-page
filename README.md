# wats1030-dynamic-page
An assignment to deploy a simple dynamic file that requires students to properly set up a server capable of serving a simple Python app.

THIS REPO IS NOT YET READY FOR YOU TO DO WORK. THIS MESSAGE WILL BE REMOVED WHEN THE REPO IS READY.

In order to learn more about how dynamic content is served, we will clone a repository containing a Python file that should be processed and rendered by the web server. This is not the most complicated setup project we can imagine, but it should serve the purpose of providing a way for us to explore how web servers can be directed to interpret specific requests in specific ways.

## Requirements
In order to succesfully complete this project, you must fulfill the following *basic requirements*:

1. Create a Droplet on Digital Ocean running the LAMP stack.
2. Clone out this repo to your project space.
3. Add `mod_wsgi` and configure Apache to run the Flask app in this repository.
4. Configure a custom domain location to show this app running.

The *stretch requirements* are:
1. Start with a blank machine and install Apache yourself.
2. Find a Flask app you can install that uses mySQL and configure that to work.
